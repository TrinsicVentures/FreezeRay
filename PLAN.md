# FreezeRay Public Release Plan

**Status:** Pre-release (internal use only)
**Target:** v1.0.0 public release
**License:** MIT
**Repository:** https://github.com/trinsic/FreezeRay (to be created)

---

## Mission

Make SwiftData schema management safe and predictable for production iOS/macOS apps by providing a zero-config tool that freezes schemas during release cycles.

**Core Value Prop:** "Freeze your schemas like you freeze your dependencies - know exactly what ships."

---

## Pre-Release Checklist (v0.1.0 → v1.0.0)

- [ ] Project structure auto-detection
- [ ] Error handling and user-friendly messages

### Phase 2: Testing & Validation

- [ ] Unit tests for schema detection logic
- [ ] Integration tests with sample SwiftData project
- [ ] Test across multiple Xcode versions (15.0, 16.0, 17.0)
- [ ] Test with various project structures (CocoaPods, SPM, standalone)
- [ ] Verify works with CloudKit-enabled schemas

### Phase 3: Configuration & Customization

- [ ] Support custom project layouts via `.freezeray.yml`
- [ ] Allow custom schema directory paths
- [ ] Allow custom fixture output paths
- [ ] Support for non-standard naming (e.g., `DataSchemaV1.swift`)
- [ ] Dry-run mode (`--dry-run` flag)

### Phase 4: Developer Experience

- [ ] Helpful error messages (not just "failed to generate SQL")
- [ ] Progress indicators for long-running operations
- [ ] Diff preview before freezing
- [ ] Interactive mode for conflict resolution
- [ ] Verbose/debug logging mode (`--verbose`)

### Phase 5: CI/CD Integration

- [ ] GitHub Actions example workflow
- [ ] GitLab CI example
- [ ] Fastlane integration guide
- [ ] Xcode Cloud integration guide
- [ ] Exit codes for scripting (0 = all frozen, 1 = unfrozen, 2 = error)

### Phase 6: Documentation

- [ ] Complete README with examples
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide
- [ ] Migration guide from manual schema management
- [ ] Best practices document
- [ ] Architecture decision record (how it works internally)
- [ ] Video walkthrough/demo

### Phase 7: Distribution

- [ ] Swift Package Manager (primary)
- [ ] Homebrew tap (`brew install trinsic/tap/freezeray`)
- [ ] Pre-built binaries for releases (GitHub Releases)
- [ ] Optional: Mint support

### Phase 8: Polish

- [ ] Version check (warn if using old version)
- [ ] Self-update command (`freezeray update`)
- [ ] Telemetry opt-in (anonymized usage stats)
- [ ] Man page generation
- [ ] Shell completion (bash/zsh/fish)

## Known Limitations (Pre-v1.0)

### Current Issues

1. **Hard-coded paths:** Assumes `app/Clearly/...` structure from Clearly project
2. **No config file:** Can't customize paths yet
3. **Limited error handling:** Crashes on missing directories
4. **No tests:** Zero test coverage
5. **Xcode-specific:** Assumes xcodebuild is available and project is named "Clearly"
6. **Simulator dependency:** Requires specific simulator to be installed
7. **No diff preview:** Can't see what changed before freezing

### Blockers for Public Release

1. ❌ **Hard-coded project name "Clearly"** in xcodebuild command
2. ❌ **No project structure detection** (assumes Clearly's layout)
3. ❌ **No error handling** for missing Xcode/simulators
4. ❌ **No tests**
5. ❌ **No documentation** beyond README
6. ❌ **No examples** (sample project)

## Post-v1.0 Roadmap

### v1.1: Schema Migration Validation

- Validate that migrations actually work (not just freeze schemas)
- Test migrations with sample data
- Detect lossy migrations (data deletion)

### v1.2: Multi-Platform Support

- Support for Linux (non-Xcode environments)
- Support for other platforms (watchOS, tvOS, visionOS schemas)

### v1.3: Advanced Features

- Schema diff visualization (graphical)
- Integration with SwiftData schema versioning
- Auto-generate migration code templates
- Emergency schema update workflow (when frozen schema has bugs)

### v2.0: Ecosystem Integration

- Xcode extension/plugin
- VS Code extension
- SwiftPM plugin (run as `swift package freeze-schemas`)
- Integration with popular schema migration tools

---

## Success Metrics (Post-Launch)

### Adoption
- 100+ GitHub stars in first 3 months
- 10+ production apps using it
- Mentioned in SwiftData blogs/tutorials

### Quality
- Zero critical bugs reported in first month
- 95%+ test coverage
- All major Xcode versions supported

### Community
- 5+ community PRs merged
- Active discussions in issues/discussions
- Positive feedback from iOS community

---

## Go-to-Market Strategy

### Announcement Channels
1. **Blog post** on Trinsic Ventures blog
2. **Tweet** from @TrinsicVentures
3. **Post on Hacker News** ("Show HN: FreezeRay - Freeze SwiftData schemas for safe releases")
4. **Swift Forums** announcement
5. **Reddit** r/swift, r/iOSProgramming
6. **iOS Dev Weekly** submission

### Content
- "Why We Built FreezeRay" blog post
- Video demo (< 2 minutes)
- Before/after comparison (manual vs. FreezeRay)
- Case study from Clearly app

### Timing
- Launch alongside Clearly 1.2.0 release
- Highlight real-world usage in production app
- Show schema freeze automation in action

---

## Open Questions

1. **Name:** Is "FreezeRay" good? Alternatives: SchemaLock, SwiftFreeze, SchemaSnap
2. **Scope:** Should it handle migrations too, or just freezing?
3. **Pricing:** Free/OSS only, or paid enterprise features later?
4. **Support:** Who maintains this long-term?
5. **Alternatives:** What do others use? Can we learn from them?

---

## Dependencies

### Required
- **SwiftSyntax** (Apache 2.0) - AST parsing
- **Swift Argument Parser** (Apache 2.0) - CLI args

### Optional (Future)
- **Rainbow** - Colored terminal output
- **Progress.swift** - Progress bars
- **Files** - File system utilities

---

## Repository Setup

### Pre-Launch

cd /Users/gk/Projects/Trinsic/FreezeRay
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - FreezeRay v0.1.0"
```

### Public Launch
```bash
# Create GitHub repo: github.com/trinsic/FreezeRay
git remote add origin git@github.com:trinsic/FreezeRay.git
git push -u origin main
git tag v1.0.0
git push --tags
```

### Repository Structure

## Next Steps (Immediate)

1. **Remove hard-coded "Clearly" references**
2. **Add project auto-detection**
3. **Write tests**
4. **Create example project**
5. **Refine README**
6. **Test on fresh machine**

Once these are done, we can do a soft launch to iOS community for feedback.
