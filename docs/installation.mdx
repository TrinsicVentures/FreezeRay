# Installation

FreezeRay consists of two components: the CLI tool and the Swift package. The CLI's `init` command handles adding the package for you.

## Install CLI Tool

Install via npm:

```bash
npm install -g @trinsicventures/freezeray
```

Verify installation:

```bash
freezeray --version
```

<Warning>
  **Apple Silicon only:** The npm package contains a precompiled binary for Apple Silicon (ARM64) Macs. Intel Mac users must build from source.
</Warning>

### Alternative: Build from Source

For Intel Macs or if you prefer to build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/TrinsicVentures/FreezeRay.git
cd FreezeRay
swift build -c release
cp .build/release/freezeray /usr/local/bin/
```

### Homebrew (Coming Soon)

```bash
brew install trinsic/tap/freezeray
```

## Initialize Your Project

Run `init` in your Xcode project directory:

```bash
cd YourProject
freezeray init
```

This will:
1. Add FreezeRay package dependency to your `Package.swift`
2. Create the `FreezeRay/` directory structure
3. Set up `.gitignore` rules (if needed)

<Info>
  The init command automatically adds the FreezeRay package to your project. No need to manually edit `Package.swift`!
</Info>

## Manual Package Installation (Alternative)

If you prefer to add the package manually:

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/TrinsicVentures/FreezeRay.git", from: "0.4.0")
]
```

Then add to your target:

```swift
.target(
    name: "YourApp",
    dependencies: ["FreezeRay"]
)
```

## Verify Installation

Check that everything is set up:

```bash
# Verify CLI
freezeray --version

# Verify package was added
swift package show-dependencies | grep FreezeRay

# Verify directory structure
ls FreezeRay/
```

## System Requirements

- macOS 14.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- Swift 5.9+
