# Welcome to FreezeRay

FreezeRay is a CLI tool and Swift macro package for freezing SwiftData schemas and validating migration paths. It prevents accidental schema changes from reaching production by creating immutable fixtures.

## Key Features

## Quick Start

Get started with FreezeRay in under 5 minutes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install FreezeRay">
    Add FreezeRay to your project via Swift Package Manager
  </Step>
  <Step title="Annotate your schema">
    Add `@FreezeSchema(version: "1.0.0")` to your schema
  </Step>
  <Step title="Freeze your schema">
    Run `freezeray freeze 1.0.0` to create fixtures
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run tests">
    Generated tests validate schema integrity automatically
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why FreezeRay?

SwiftData makes it easy to evolve your data model, but accidental schema changes can break user data. FreezeRay helps you:

- **Prevent breaking changes** by catching schema drift in CI
- **Test migrations confidently** with automated migration path validation
- **Document schema evolution** with versioned fixtures in your repo
- **Maintain backwards compatibility** across app versions

## Architecture

FreezeRay uses a hybrid CLI + macro approach:

1. **CLI tool** orchestrates schema freezing in iOS Simulator
2. **Swift macros** provide type-safe schema annotations
3. **Generated tests** validate schema integrity and migrations
4. **Fixtures** are committed to your repo for full traceability
