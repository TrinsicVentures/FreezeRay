# Sprint 4: Documentation & Distribution

**Version:** v0.4.0 → v0.4.1
**Dates:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

## Goals

Prepare FreezeRay for public release with:
1. **Documentation site** - Professional docs at docs.freezeray.dev
2. **npm distribution** - Easy CLI installation via `npm install -g`
3. **mise task automation** - Centralized task management
4. **Accurate problem framing** - Document real-world SwiftData issues

## What We Built

### 1. Mintlify Documentation Site ✅

**Setup:**
- Transferred repo from didgeoridoo → TrinsicVentures
- Made repo public with MIT license
- Created `docs/` directory with docs.json (not mint.json - that's deprecated)
- Installed Mintlify GitHub app
- Configured custom domain: docs.freezeray.dev

**Documentation Structure:**
```
docs/
├── docs.json                      # Mintlify configuration
├── introduction.mdx               # Landing page with 3 problems
├── quickstart.mdx                 # npm-first getting started
├── installation.mdx               # CLI installation guide
├── concepts/                      # Core concepts
│   ├── schema-freezing.mdx
│   ├── migration-testing.mdx
│   └── drift-detection.mdx
├── cli/                          # CLI command reference
│   ├── init.mdx
│   └── freeze.mdx
├── macros/                       # Macro reference
│   └── freeze-schema.mdx
└── guides/                       # Tutorial guides
    ├── first-freeze.mdx
    ├── testing-migrations.mdx
    └── ci-integration.mdx
```

**Key Content:**
- Introduction documents the 3 real problems FreezeRay solves (researched from deleted git history)
- Quickstart focuses on CLI workflow (npm install first, not manual Package.swift)
- Installation emphasizes npm as primary method
- Layered defense explained: checksums → real migrations → custom validation

**Live at:** https://docs.freezeray.dev

**Status:** Minimal viable docs site - more work needed:
- Still using default Mintlify theme/colors
- Mintlify logo instead of FreezeRay logo
- Many placeholder pages (concepts, CLI reference, guides)
- Needs custom styling and branding

### 2. npm Distribution (ADR-007) ✅

**Challenge Discovered:**
- Initial attempt used symlink: `ln -s ../../../.build/release/freezeray`
- npm does NOT follow symlinks pointing outside package directory
- v0.4.0 published without binary (914 bytes - just JSON + README)

**Solution:**
- Copy binary to `release/npm/bin/` at publish time
- Automated via mise task
- Added to `.gitignore` to avoid committing 21MB binary

**Published Versions:**
- v0.4.0: Published without binary (symlink bug)
- v0.4.1: Published with binary (4.9MB compressed, 21.6MB unpacked)

**Installation:**
```bash
npm install -g @trinsicventures/freezeray
```

**Scoped Package:** Used `@trinsicventures/freezeray` because `freezeray` was taken

**Files Created:**
- `release/npm/package.json` - npm metadata
- `release/npm/README.md` - npm package README (Apple Silicon warning)
- `release/npm/bin/` - Binary directory (gitignored)
- `project/adr/ADR-007-npm-binary-distribution.md`

### 3. mise Task Automation ✅

**Created `.mise.toml`** with centralized tasks:

```toml
[tasks.build]
description = "Build CLI binary for release"
run = "swift build -c release --arch arm64"

[tasks.test]
description = "Run unit tests"
run = "swift test"

[tasks."test:e2e"]
description = "Run E2E tests with FreezeRayTestApp"
run = """
cd FreezeRayTestApp
xcodebuild test -project FreezeRayTestApp.xcodeproj -scheme FreezeRayTestApp -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17'
"""

[tasks."publish:npm"]
description = "Publish CLI to npm"
depends = ["build"]
run = """
#!/bin/bash
set -e
mkdir -p release/npm/bin
cp .build/release/freezeray release/npm/bin/freezeray
chmod +x release/npm/bin/freezeray
cd release/npm
npm publish --access public
"""

[tasks."docs:dev"]
description = "Run Mintlify docs locally"
run = "cd docs && mintlify dev"

[tasks.clean]
description = "Clean build artifacts"
run = """
swift package clean
rm -f release/npm/bin/freezeray
rm -f release/npm/*.tgz
"""
```

**Benefits:**
- Single command for complex workflows: `mise run publish:npm`
- Automatic dependency resolution (publish depends on build)
- Self-documenting (`mise tasks` shows all available tasks)
- CI/CD ready

### 4. Problem Documentation Research ✅

**Git History Recovery:**
Found deleted documentation of the 3 problems FreezeRay solves (from commit b04c855):

**Problem 1: Inscrutable Error Messages**
- `Cannot use staged migration with an unknown model version`
- `Persistent store migration failed, missing source managed object model`
- Root causes: Modifying shipped schemas, not including all models
- **FreezeRay solution:** Checksum-based drift detection with clear errors

**Problem 2: Production Crashes (Not Caught in Testing)**
- Fresh installs work, existing users crash on launch
- Tests use fresh simulators that skip migration entirely
- **FreezeRay solution:** Real frozen fixtures force migration in tests

**Problem 3: Silent Data Loss**
- Migration succeeds without errors but corrupts/loses data
- Non-optional properties without defaults, transformable types changing shape
- **FreezeRay solution:** Scaffolded tests with TODO markers for custom validation

**Layered Defense Model:**
1. **Checksums** (fast, clear errors) - Catches drift before SwiftData crashes
2. **Real migration tests** (forces crashes in tests) - Better to crash in CI than production
3. **Custom validation** (user-defined) - Ensures data integrity after migration

**Sources Referenced:**
- Apple Developer Forums threads
- Stack Overflow questions (78958039, 78756798, 79536880)
- Mert Bulan's "never use SwiftData without VersionedSchema" article

## Implementation Details

### npm Publishing Workflow

**Manual:**
```bash
swift build -c release --arch arm64
mkdir -p release/npm/bin
cp .build/release/freezeray release/npm/bin/
cd release/npm
npm publish --access public
```

**Automated via mise:**
```bash
mise run publish:npm
```

**Why Not Symlink?**
- npm only follows symlinks within package directory
- External symlinks (../../../) are ignored during pack/publish
- Must copy binary or commit it (we chose copy + gitignore)

### Documentation Deployment

**Mintlify Auto-Deploy:**
1. Edit markdown files in `docs/`
2. Commit to GitHub
3. Mintlify automatically rebuilds and deploys
4. Live at docs.freezeray.dev within seconds

**No CI/CD setup needed** - Mintlify handles everything

### Version Management

- Swift Package: Defined in Package.swift
- npm package: Defined in release/npm/package.json
- Must be kept in sync manually (automated in CI later)

## Files Changed

### New Files
- `.mise.toml` - Task automation config
- `docs/` directory - Complete Mintlify documentation structure (14 files)
- `release/npm/package.json` - npm package metadata
- `release/npm/README.md` - npm-specific README
- `project/adr/ADR-007-npm-binary-distribution.md`
- `project/sprints/v0.4.0-sprint_4-docs-and-distribution.md` (this file)

### Modified Files
- `LICENSE` - Changed copyright from "George Kostakos" to "Trinsic Ventures"
- `.gitignore` - Added release/npm/bin/, release/npm/*.tgz, release/npm/.npmrc
- `CLAUDE.md` - Added mise tasks, npm publishing workflow, updated project structure
- `docs/introduction.mdx` - Added 3 problems + layered defense
- `docs/quickstart.mdx` - npm-first workflow
- `docs/installation.mdx` - npm as primary installation method

### Deleted Files
- (Considered) `release/freezeray-docs` repo - Decided on monorepo with docs/ instead

## Key Decisions

### Why Mintlify over Docusaurus?

**Decision:** Use Mintlify (free tier with custom domain)

**Rationale:**
- Zero infrastructure (Mintlify hosts)
- Live in 10 minutes vs days for Docusaurus
- Professional design out-of-the-box
- Custom domain (docs.freezeray.dev) included on free tier
- Git-based workflow (edit markdown, auto-deploys)
- Free tier sufficient (1 dashboard member, no team features needed)

**Alternative rejected:** Self-hosted Docusaurus requires Vercel hosting, React maintenance, slower setup

### Why release/ Directory?

**Decision:** Use `release/` for distribution configs (not `dist/`, `packaging/`, or `distributions/`)

**Rationale:**
- `release/` = "how we release" (process), not "contains releases" (artifacts)
- Clear it's about release process, not build artifacts
- `.build/` already handled by gitignore for build artifacts
- Room for `release/homebrew/` later

**Alternatives rejected:**
- `dist/` - Implies gitignored build artifacts
- `packaging/` - Overloaded term (Swift Package vs distribution)
- `distributions/` - Too long, rarely typed anyway

### Why Copy Binary Instead of Symlink?

**Decision:** Copy binary to `release/npm/bin/` during publish

**Rationale:**
- npm ignores symlinks pointing outside package directory (discovered via failed publish)
- Copying ensures binary is included in npm tarball
- Automated via mise task (build + copy + publish)
- Still no git bloat (binary gitignored)

**Alternative rejected:** Symlink approach failed - v0.4.0 published without binary

## Testing

### npm Package Testing

**Local test:**
```bash
cd release/npm
npm pack
tar -tzf trinsicventures-freezeray-0.4.1.tgz
# Verify: package/bin/freezeray present (21.6MB)
```

**Installation test:**
```bash
npm install -g @trinsicventures/freezeray
freezeray --version
# Output: 0.4.1
```

**E2E Test:**
```bash
npm install -g @trinsicventures/freezeray
cd FreezeRayTestApp
freezeray freeze 1.0.0
# Verify: Fixtures created, tests scaffolded
```

### Documentation Testing

**Local preview:**
```bash
mise run docs:dev
# Opens http://localhost:3000
```

**Production verification:**
- Visit https://docs.freezeray.dev
- Verify all pages render
- Test navigation
- Verify code blocks syntax highlighting
